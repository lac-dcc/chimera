## Goals
This repository contains **ChiGen** and **ChiBench**, two tools designed to test and debug electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Below, you'll find descriptions of each tool and how they can be utilized.

### ChiBench

**ChiBench** consists of a large collection of Verilog programs mined from open-source github repositories.
The goal of this benchmark suite is to test and debug electronic design automation (EDA) tools, such as the [Jasper Formal Verification Platform](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/system-design-and-verification/formal-and-static-verification.html) or [Intel Quartus](https://www.intel.com.br/content/www/br/pt/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime.html).
To test your EDA tool, simply pass all the programs in the ChiBench collection to it, and see if it crashes.

### ChiGen

**ChiGen** is a  tool designed for synthesizing realistic Verilog designs to test and debug Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Originally developed to validate the [Jasper Formal Verification Platform](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/system-design-and-verification/formal-and-static-verification.html), ChiGen has proven to be highly effective in identifying bugs across a wide range of tools, including Verible, Verilator, and Yosys. A tutorial to get started with ChiGen can be found below. 




## ChiGen Tutorial 
### Installing
#### 1. Clone Chimera: 
  ```
  git clone  https://github.com/lac-dcc/chimera.git
  ``` 

#### 2. Build Verible
The verible binary is in the `verible_bin` folder. However, if the binary does not work on the computer, try building it from [source](https://github.com/joaovam/verible/tree/73f291dc73d38e8f876ce9cc35aad62ff932f138)

<!-- - Install [Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel)  -->


<!-- `sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg -y | gpg --dearmor >bazel-archive-keyring.gpg` -->

#### 3. Build Chigen
```
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 4. Train probabilistic grammar
In this step, there are 2 options: 
1. Train the grammar from scratch (which may take some hours to complete). The `verible-verilog-syntax` binary can be generated by compiling a modified version of Verible in [this](https://github.com/joaovam/verible/tree/73f291dc73d38e8f876ce9cc35aad62ff932f138) repository. 
  ```
  ./scripts/run_parser_count_productions.sh ./database verible-verilog-syntax grammar.json
  ```
  
2. Use one of the pre-trained grammars available in the `json` folder (recommended).


### 5. Run
If you opted to train the grammar from scratch, simply run the following command:
```
./build/Chimera grammar.json 1 > program.v
```
If you chose to use a pre-trained grammar, replace `grammar.json` with the grammar file you selected. For example:
```
./build/Chimera ./json/1gram_size_test.json 1 > program.v
```
### 6. Format (optional)
```
verible-verilog-format --inplace program.v
```

If you ever use ChiBench or ChiGen to find bugs in some EDA tool, we would appreciate it very much if you could reach out to us and report your experience.
If you need help to set up the scripts to do this kind of exploration, feel free to reach out to us as well!

## Use cases
We have found various bugs in open-source platforms with programs from ChiBench and ChiGen. Below we list examples of issues reported:

## Technical Report

The process of constructing and curating this collection of benchmarks is described on this [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06550).

## Provenance

ChiBench contains only programs that were originally distributed with some license.
Thus, each program in the ChiBench suite contains, as a header comment, the original license of that specification, plus a link to the repository from where that code was obtained.
Notice that these programs might use different licenses, given that they were extracted from different projects.
On May 24th, 2024, the following licenses were used among the repositories mined to build the ChiBench collection:
