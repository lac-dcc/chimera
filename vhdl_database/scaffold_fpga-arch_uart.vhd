-- UART transmitter and receiver.
--
-- This entity just regroups uart_tx and uart_rx entities.
-- Configurable baudrate and parity mode are the same of the transmitter and the
-- receiver.
--
-- Changing parity mode or baudrate during a transmission will corrupt outgoing
-- or incomming data.
--
-- There is no memory to hold the received data or to stack the bytes to be
-- transmitted.
