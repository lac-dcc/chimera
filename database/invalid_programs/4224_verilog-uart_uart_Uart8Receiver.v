/*
 * 8-bit UART Receiver.
 * Able to receive 8 bits of serial data, one start bit, one stop bit.
 * When receive is complete {done} is driven high for one clock cycle.
 * Output data should be taken away by a few clocks or can be lost.
 * When receive is in progress {busy} is driven high.
 * Clock should be decreased to baud rate.
